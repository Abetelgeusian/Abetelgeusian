### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Harshal.

I am a master's student at Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research focusing on vehicle autonomy.
I am interested in Machine Learning, Reinforcement learning and their application in vehicles.

You will see all my project work here. Some of the repositories have course names. I have explained below what to expect in each repository.

ECE-6420-Knowledge-Engineering\
This repo contains different machine learning problems I have solved to learn/create ML foundation.

AuE8230Spring22_Harshal_Varpe \
AuE8230_Spring22_Group3     
Both of these repositories contain my projects related to Robotic Operating Systems (ROS). The Work in both repositories is different.

ECE631 Introduction to Computer Vision \
This repository contains all the mini-projects completed to understand the underlining workings of Computer Vision. All the work in this repo is done in C.



Skills: Python, C, C++
